Subject: Important notice about your account – two factor authentication code (Sample PHI-00005)

This is a simulated phishing email example (#5) created only for security education and spam-filter research in 2024–2025. It is not a real message and must never be used to deceive anyone.

In real communication, people may misuse phrases like “two factor authentication code” to pressure, confuse, or mislead the reader. The text below mimics that style so detection systems can learn to recognize and filter it.

Dear Customer,

We are writing to show how a suspicious sign-in or account notice can look. A real scammer might include wording such as “two factor authentication code”, pretend to be a trusted brand, and try to push you into clicking a link or sharing private data.

For this training sample, everything here is fake and for practice only. Do not treat it as a real request and never send similar text to anyone.
