Subject: Service message: tracking number (Sample SOL-00012)

This is a simulated solicited email example (#12) created only for security education and spam-filter research in 2024–2025. It is not a real message and must never be used to deceive anyone.

In real communication, people may misuse phrases like “tracking number” to pressure, confuse, or mislead the reader. The text below mimics that style so detection systems can learn to recognize and filter it.

Dear Customer,

This is an example of a normal, solicited service email. It may use a term such as “tracking number” because the recipient started a purchase, booking, or support ticket. A legitimate notice explains the situation calmly and does not demand secret information or pressure you into rushed choices.
